# Hello Codespace users

This page is for those who've opened this repo in GitHub Codespaces.

## Initial setup
The setup of a new Codespace instance may take about 13 minutes. Your new Codespaces is doing the following:
* Preparing the Codespace
* Downloading Python packages
* Downloading NPM packages
* Building the web UI

## Running the Data Formulator app
After your Codespace initialization is complete, click the Run and Debug tab in the online VSCode interface.

At the top of the Run and Debug tab, click the Start Debugging button with the green arrow (or press F5).

You will soon see a notification that says "Your application running on port 5000 is available." CLick Open in Browser to see the Data Formulator app in a new tab.

If the notification disappears, you can always go to the Ports tab in the terminal pane, and click the link for port 5000 to open the app in a new tab.
